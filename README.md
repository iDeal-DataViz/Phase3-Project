# Predicting Customer Churn at SyriaTel
## What I did:
This project aimed to predict which SyriaTel customers are likely to stop using their service. We used machine learning to identify these customers and understand why they might leave.

## Why it is important:
Losing customers hurts SyriaTel's business. By knowing which customers are at risk, we can take steps to keep them. This helps SyriaTel grow and make more money.

## Who will this help?:
This project helps SyriaTel's management team, especially those who work on keeping customers happy (customer retention), marketing, and making business decisions. They can use our findings to improve customer loyalty.

## Data used:
I analyzed customer data, including:

Account information: Like where they live and their service plans. Call usage: How often they make calls, especially at different times of day and internationally. Customer service history: How often they contacted support. Whether they left SyriaTel: This was the most important piece of information. We cleaned and prepared the data to make sure it was accurate for our models.

## Building the model:
First, I used a simple model (Logistic Regression) to get a basic understanding. I looked at key factors like customer service calls, international plans, and how much people used their phones. Then, I used a more advanced model called Random Forest. This model is better at making accurate predictions and helps us understand which factors are most important. I carefully tuned the model to get the best possible results.

## My findings:
The Random Forest model was the most accurate. It correctly identified many customers who actually left. Key factors that make customers leave: Frequent customer service calls: This often means customers are unhappy. Having an international plan: These customers may have specific needs that aren't being met. High phone usage: While valuable, these customers might need special attention to keep them satisfied.

## What SyriaTel can do:
Improve customer service: Respond quickly to customer concerns and proactively reach out to those who contact support often. Offer better international plans: Tailor plans to meet the needs of international travelers. Reward loyal customers: Offer special deals or rewards to keep high-usage customers happy.

## In summary:
This project shows how using machine learning can help SyriaTel predict and prevent customer churn. By understanding customer behavior, SyriaTel can take action to improve customer satisfaction and grow their business.
